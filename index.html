                <div class="lefttext">Far too often are you, the candidate, treated as someone to help an agent ‘fill a job’. You only receive calls back from an agent when they have the perfect job for you, which 9 times out of 10 does not match up to the criteria you had previously discussed. Why won’t the agent tell you who the company is when you call up regarding an advert…probably because they don’t trust you!? This does not sound like the foundations you want a relationship to be built on when this recruiter is supposed to represent you in the best light to potential employers. This is where we differ! </div>
                <div class="righttext">We will not withhold information about a vacancy; we will be as honest about the business as possible. We are not here to try and sell you an opportunity and convince you it is the right move. All we ask from the candidates we work with is honesty. We are here to work with you! We currently work with thousands of candidates, these individuals are not actively looking to move however we continue to keep them abreast with developments across their industry.</div>
